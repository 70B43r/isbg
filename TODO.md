<h1> Todo list </h1>

* Auto report messages to Razor (high scoring ones that are definitely spam)
* Seperate out messages that may be false positives (scores
  close to SpamAssassin thresholds) from the definite spam ones.
* Integrate multiple accounts function to main program
    * a conf file in the working dir by default (/etc/isbg/ in Debian)
    * no encryption (too complicated atm, but would be nice)
* Write program as main()
* Delete the semi-encryption of passwords (Security through obscurity !=
  security)
